# Movie Recommender System üé¨

This Movie Recommender System is a web application built with Streamlit that recommends movies based on the similarity to a selected movie. The app uses machine learning to find the closest movies based on a precomputed similarity matrix, and displays the movie posters using data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
